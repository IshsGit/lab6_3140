Lab 6

The objective here is to:

* Create a Repository called Repo1
* Produce a file called “helloworld.java”
* Add it to the master branch
* Commit 
* Save a log.txt in another repository called RepoMeta
* Push the log.txt to a host i.e github

Creating a Repository:
I create a folder on desktop called Repo1. I right clicked and hit git bash here that way it opens a terminal at the location of my intended repository. In order for it to be recognized as a repository I used the command git init

Creating helloworld.java
I used VIM from the Repo1 repository, inserted some text like todays date and hello world, hit ESC, saved the file as helloworld.java and exited. Now helloworld.java is in Repo1 but still need to add it to the branch.

Adding helloworld.java to master
Right now, I only have the master branch. If I were working on a project then I would create several branches with the git branch “branchname” command. Anytime I want to revert back to a previous build, it is just a matter of using git checkout “branchname” and that would return the respective project file to the state it was on the branch that it was checked or switched into.

Making a commit
In order to push anything I will first need to commit. The commits are also recorded when creating a log file. After I enter git commit it opens VIM and I simply uncommented useful information in regards to the recent activity which was just an initial commit and adding hellworld.java to master.

Creating log.txt
To create a log.txt I simply used the git log > “log.txt” command which pushes a history of commits into a log.txt

Moving log.txt to RepoMeta (Repeat above steps mostly)
I create a folder on desktop called RepoMeta. I right clicked and hit git bash here that way it opens a terminal at the location of my intended repository. In order for it to be recognized as a repository I used the command git init

In order to push anything I will first need to commit. The commits are also recorded when creating a log file. After I enter git commit it opens VIM and I simply uncommented useful information

Push the log.txt to a host i.e github
Then lastly using the git push origin master. This requires authentication however afterwards it is pushed into the repo
